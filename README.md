# ERD

# Assignment

This project based on **22.14.0 LTS of Node.js** and **11.7.0 version of MariaDB**.

## Prerequisites
Databases `nest_assignment_development`, `nest_assignment_production` and `nestjs_assignment_test` should be created in the MariaDB.

```sql
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_development@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_development';
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_production@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_production';
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_test@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_test';
```

Don't forget to grant privileges to each users with 'localhost';

## Install dependencies
```bash
# npm
$ npm install

# yarn, pnpm, bun, etc.
$ <package-manager> install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Running tests

Testing generates a local SQLite database. The database location will be depended on the `TYPEORM_DATABASE` path in the `.env.test` file.

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Authentication

This API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. All requests must include a valid JWT token in the `xt-sol-api-key` header. Tokens expire in 10 minutes.

### Getting a Token

To get a JWT token, first create a user, then login with their email:

1. Create a user:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{
       "firstName": "John",
       "lastName": "Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "location": "New York"
     }' \
     --url "localhost:3000/users/create"
```

2. Login to get a token:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{"email": "john@example.com"}' \
     --url "localhost:3000/users/login"
```

This will return:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

# Requests

When sending HTTP requests, include the JWT token in the `xt-sol-api-key` header. If the header is not included or the token is invalid/expired, the server will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code.

Example request:
```bash
curl --url "localhost:3000/users/email/john@example.com" \
     --header "xt-sol-api-key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

# Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations
$ npm run migration:run

# Revert migrations
$ npm run migration:revert
```
