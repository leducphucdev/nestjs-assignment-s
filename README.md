- **Implement the task service** in <ins>src/api/tasks</ins> by referring to other services, modules, DTOs, and the tasks-api.md document.
- Wrtie the test code **tasks.service.spec.ts** like others
- Modify your code to pass **all of unit and e2e tests.**
- The execution code and test code are implemented, but please find the parts that are **missing from the API documentation** and update the API documentation as well.
- Change the authentication method, **use JWT** and it is **only valid for 10 minutes**,

    and change the **HTTP header name** from x-api-key to **xt-sol-api-key**,

# ERD

# Assignment

This project based on **22.14.0 LTS of Node.js** and **11.7.0 version of MariaDB**.

## Prerequisites
Databases `nest_assignment_development`, `nest_assignment_production` and `nestjs_assignment_test` should be created in the MariaDB.

```sql
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_development@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_development';
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_production@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_production';
CREATE USER nestjs_assignment_test@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'nestjs_assignment_test';
```

Don't forget to grant privileges to each users with 'localhost';

## Install dependencies
```bash
# npm
$ npm install

# yarn, pnpm, bun, etc.
$ <package-manager> install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Running tests

Testing generates a local SQLite database. The database location will be depended on the `TYPEORM_DATABASE` path in the `.env.test` file.

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Extra

Each request checks for the `x-api-key` header. If the header is not included, or an invalid API key is given, a `403 Forbidden` status code will be returned. An active API key needs to be created to send any requests. You can create a new API key by connecting to the database and running the following  SQL command:

```sql
-- development or production database
INSERT INTO api_key (id, is_active) VALUES (uuid(), true);
```

This will create a new active API key with a random UUID as its `key` column value. You can find the API key by running the following SQL command:

```sql
-- development or production database
SELECT * FROM api_key;
```

# Requests

When sending HTTP requests, either via Postman or any other tool, make sure to include the `x-api-key` header with any appropriate value. If the `x-api-key` header is not included, the server will respond with a `403 Forbidden` status code.

Example request:
```bash
curl --url "localhost:3000/users/email/example@email.com" \
     --header "x-api-key: ac70ca11-5d7f-4ca3-bede-fb1a06a36d28"
```

# Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations
$ npm run migration:run

# Revert migrations
$ npm run migration:revert
```
